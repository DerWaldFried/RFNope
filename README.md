## Avoid Broadcasting Fee, Strike German Broadcasting Corporation

** RFNope ** is a free software, in that case often called freeware. Its purpose is to enable the end user to no longer visit and receive radio stations and services from the German state broadcaster on the computer or other devices. Why is this so? Many other websites and groups can explain this much more intensively.

This freeware currently makes it possible:
- Block websites from radio YouTube channels and from state broadcasters on the home computer.

Planned are the following possibilities and functions:
- Block services from broadcasters and their sub-companies (advertisements, image servers, media servers and so on).
- A possibility to voluntarily enter the websites and service into the program and they will be blocked after a check with all users of the freeware as well. Thus, the swarm intelligence is used to really find and block all offers from radio and broadcasting Germany.
- An Android app that makes it possible to block apps, updates, services and websites from German radio and broadcasting there as well.
- A certificate as PDF documenting when the spear was installed, if it was always used (if not how long) and which devices use this freeware by the user.
- A VPN connection for less than 5 â‚¬ per month, which blocks all services and possibilities of the German Radio and Broadcasting, so that one does not have to change the individual devices.

The main software will always remain free in the functions. We prohibit other developers and companies to use our idea in its construction to make money with it.
